# Quotix

🧠 Quotix is an AI-powered assistant that helps users generate accurate and structured home service quotes — starting from natural language descriptions and images.

🔍 No forms. No calls. Just describe your problem, and Quotix will do the rest:
- Understand the request (text and images)
- Ask clarifying questions if needed
- Estimate time, cost, and materials
- Generate a quote, optionally compare it to online services

🚧 This is an open-source project — still at an early stage.  
Built with **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, and **Python**.

## Vision

People should be able to get quotes without having to explain everything five times.  
Quotix aims to make that process faster, smarter, and human-friendly — through intelligent agents.
